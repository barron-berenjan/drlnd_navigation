    "The learning algorithm implemented for this assignment is the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf\">Dueling Network</a>. The architecture is similiar to a Deep Q-Network, employing the same fundamental tenets such as experience replay and fixed-Q targets. The primary difference is in the estimation of $Q$ values. Rather than estimating $Q(s,a)$  directly, the duelling network seperates the final fully connected linear layer of a a DQN into two streams: one to estimate the state value $V(s)$ and the other to estimate the advantage $A(s,a)$ of taking an action $a$ in state $s$, with $Q(s,a)$ estimated with:\n",
